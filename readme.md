For this exercise I am creating 2 js files. One with just 1 class and 1 with a more cohesive code.

### Requirements

SecretDiary
  - lock()
  - unlock()
  - addEntry()
  - getEntries()
Diagram the secret diary example, and then implement the following requirements:

Initially the SecretDiary class is locked, meaning addEntry(str) and getEntries() should throw an error.
When the user calls unlock(), addEntry() and getEntries() should work as desired.
When the user calls lock() again addEntry() and getEntries() throw errors.
First organise it into one class only.

Then, reorganise it into classes with high cohesion.
